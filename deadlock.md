# Java Deadlocks

When a deadlock occurs in your program, two or more threads are stuck waiting for each other to release resources that they currently hold. This situation creates a standstill where none of the involved threads can proceed. Deadlocks can be tricky to diagnose because the symptoms might just look like the program has frozen or become unresponsive. Here are some key indicators and methods to identify deadlocks:

## Indicators of Deadlock

    1. Program Freeze: The most immediate sign of a deadlock is when parts of your program stop responding, even though the CPU usage might be low.

    1. No Progress: Tasks that were supposed to complete don't finish, and no further output is produced.

    1. Resource Utilization: Resources (like locks, file handles, etc.) are not released, leading to high resource usage without apparent progress.

## How to Identify Deadlock

    1. Thread Dumps: Generate a thread dump to inspect the state of all threads and see if any are waiting on locks. In Java, you can generate a thread dump by sending a SIGQUIT signal (usually Ctrl+\ or kill -3 <pid>) to the process. Look for threads in BLOCKED or WAITING state.

    1. Logging: Add detailed logging around the synchronization points (where locks are acquired) to trace the sequence of operations and identify where threads are stuck.

    1. Using Tools: Use monitoring tools like VisualVM, JConsole, or other thread analysis tools to visualize thread states and detect deadlocks.

    1. Java Built-in Deadlock Detection: Java has built-in deadlock detection in tools like jstack or using the Java VisualVM profiler which can help to identify and analyze deadlocks.

## Example of Deadlock Identification with a Thread Dump

If you run your game with the deadlock option enabled and notice it freezes, you can generate a thread dump to investigate:

* Using jstack

    1. Find the process ID (PID) of your Java application. You can do this using jps or your task manager.

    1. Generate a thread dump using jstack:

      ```bash

      jstack <pid> > threadDump.txt

      ```

    1. Open the threadDump.txt file and look for threads in BLOCKED state and the resources they are waiting to acquire.

* Sample Output

In the thread dump, you might see something like this:

```bash

Thread-1:
   at hackathon.GamePanel.simulateDeadlock(GamePanel.java:XXX)
   - waiting to lock <0x12345678> (a java.lang.Object)
   - locked <0x87654321> (a java.lang.Object)
Thread-2:
   at hackathon.GamePanel.simulateDeadlock(GamePanel.java:XXX)
   - waiting to lock <0x87654321> (a java.lang.Object)
   - locked <0x12345678> (a java.lang.Object)
```

In this example, Thread-1 and Thread-2 are waiting for each other's locks, indicating a deadlock.
Handling Deadlock

* Deadlocks can often be resolved by:

    1. Avoiding Nested Locks: Avoid acquiring multiple locks at the same time.

    1. Lock Ordering: Always acquire multiple locks in a consistent order.

    1. Using Try-Lock: Use tryLock with a timeout to attempt acquiring locks and back off if not successful.
By using these methods and tools, you can diagnose and understand deadlocks in your program.
